# Paradise Media Player
Developed by Tamer Alssaleh (Paradoxial)
### Version: 0.1.0
## About This Project
This project was primarily developed to show proficiency in as many C# concepts as possible, from OOP, switch/case statements, to looping logic, and more. I also wanted to design a simple application that just allows me to open an mp3 or any audio file I want whenever I am relaxing and listening to music.

## How to Use
#### Startup
To utilize this application, simply unzip the .zip file, and double-click on the `MediaPlayer.exe` to start the application. Then, click on either "Play", "Add" or "File" -> "Open" or "Open Folder" to add files to your playlist. Then simply click on a file in the playlist box, then click "Play".
#### Autoplay
Autoplay is a feature found under the settings tab, simply click "Toggle Autoplay" and whenever it says "Autoplay ON" at the top of the window, that means the next file will begin playing right after the current one finishes.
#### File Types
Keep in mind only a select few formats are available at this time. Specifically mp2, mp3, ogg, wav, and a few others.
